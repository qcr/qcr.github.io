Python Robotics is a collection of software packages providing robotics-specific functionality to Python. While leveraging Python's advantages of portability, ubiquity and support, and the capability of the open-source ecosystem for linear algebra (numpy, scipy), graphics (matplotlib, three.js, WebGL), interactive development (jupyter, jupyterlab, mybinder.org), and documentation (sphinx).

The collection is built on top of Spatialmath which underpins all of robotics and robotic vision where we need to describe the position, orientation or pose of objects in 2D or 3D spaces. The core of the collection is the the Robotics Toolbox for Python while Swift provides a light-weight browser-based simulation environment.
