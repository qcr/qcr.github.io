**Description:**

GoPro vision-only dataset gathered on a late afternoon / evening approximately 10 km drive (one way) into and out of the Brisbane metropolitan area. Lots of varied traffic and interesting pedestrian situations. Map shows inbound route (part 1), return route (part 2) is approximately in reverse but has some extra suburban streets at the end.

Settings: 1080p 30 fps wide FOV setting on a GoPro 4 Silver.

Download links for both parts can be accessed via the button above.
