A vision dataset gathered from a car driven around Alderley, Queensland in two different conditions for the same route: one on a sunny day and one during a rainy night. The dataset includes extracted frames from the original .avi video files, as well as manually ground-truthed frame correspondences. The dataset was first used in the ICRA2012 Best Robot Vision Paper:

M. Milford, G. Wyeth, "SeqSLAM: Visual route-based navigation for sunny summer days and stormy winter nights", in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, St Paul, United States, 2012.
