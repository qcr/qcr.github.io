A ROS and OpenCV version of RatSLAM is available at: [Google Code](https://code.google.com/archive/p/ratslam/)

Please see the following paper for more information about openRatSLAM. We would appreciate cites if you use the code.

We provide the following datasets here, which can all be downloaded via the button above.

**iRat 2011 Australia**

The iRat - intelligent Rat animat technology

**St Lucia 2007**

See the [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0XSUi69Yvs) describing this dataset.

**Oxford's New College 2008**

We have re-encoded Oxford's dataset that is available [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/NewCollegeData/) into a rosbag file. The rosbag file only include the odometry and the panoramic image sensor data. The odometry has been integrated to be at the same rate (3Hz) as the panoramic images. Note that this re-encoded datset file has been created without permission and is maintained purely by us.
