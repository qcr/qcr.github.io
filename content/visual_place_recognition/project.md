This collection features code related to Visual Place Recognition (VPR) research, which is concerned with the fundamental problem of how a robot or autonomous vehicle uses perception to create maps and calculates and tracks its location in the world. Research questions include addressing how:
- the appearance of a place changes in relation as a function of time, season, weather, viewpoint and environment type
- understanding context and semantics can enhance performance
- lifelong reliability can be achieved as the world continually changes
- the relationship to neurological structures and behavioural mechanisms are used in animal and human navigation; and how new perception technologies can be applied to this problem.
