The route was traversed again, another five times, two weeks later for a total of ten datasets. GPS data is included for each dataset.</p>\n<p>Full details of how to use the dataset and individual download links are available from:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/St+Lucia+Multiple+Times+of+Day\">https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/St+Lucia+Multiple+Times+of+Day</a></p>\n","name":"St Lucia multiple times of day","type":"dataset","url":"https://huggingface.co/datasets/medwa126/UQStLuciaMultipleToD/","url_type":"external","image":"./st_lucia_multiple.jpg","size":"1.46GB","_images":["/_next/static/images/st_lucia_multiple-2cbaafdfc8e48c3435bf99f7dd1664c7.jpg.webp","/_next/static/images/st_lucia_multiple-a633d97afbaa94da3e29001a6583b448.jpg"],"src":"/content/legacy_datasets/st_lucia_multiple.md","id":"st-lucia-multiple","image_position":"center"}},"__N_SSG":true}
