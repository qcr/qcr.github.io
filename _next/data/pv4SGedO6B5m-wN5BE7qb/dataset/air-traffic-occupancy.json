The data was processed to extract the aircraft patterns on a grid at certain sampling points, and aircraft count information used to identify busy and quiet traffic environments. The aircraft pattern and traffic environment class is made available in this dataset.</p>\n","name":"Air Traffic Occupancy Data","type":"dataset","url":"https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/wPCSZ6Znipez1vC","image":"./airspace_traffic_occupation.jpg","size":"19.5MB","id":"air-traffic-occupancy","_images":["/_next/static/images/airspace_traffic_occupation-d8931212d7eaeaba10c2acf785a0ecd9.jpg.webp","/_next/static/images/airspace_traffic_occupation-01dcbf21de2f822245f4bd51c364dc3a.jpg"],"src":"/content/aircraft_detection/airspace_traffic_occupancy.md","image_position":"center"}},"__N_SSG":true}
