This data consists of real-world images of fish captured in conditions defined as \"controlled\", \"out-of-the-water\" and \"in-situ\". The \"controlled\", images consists of fish specimens, with their fins spread, taken against a constant background with controlled illumination. The \"in-situ\" images are underwater images of fish in their natural habitat and so there is no control over background or illumination. The \"out-of-the-water\" images consist of fish specimens, taken out of the water with a varying background and limited control over the illumination conditions. A tight red bounding box is annotated around the fish.</p>\n<p>Full details of how to use the dataset and individual download links are available from:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Fish+Dataset\">https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Fish+Dataset</a></p>\n","name":"Fish images","type":"dataset","url":"https://wiki.qut.edu.au/display/cyphy/Fish+Dataset","url_type":"external","image":"./fish_image.png","size":"512MB","_images":["/_next/static/images/fish_image-a252b1d6bfcba0ada070ce6af73fc92b.png.webp","/_next/static/images/fish_image-d74fa618dc09390794a0785ebede2291.png"],"src":"/content/legacy_datasets/fish_image.md","id":"fish-image","image_position":"center"}},"__N_SSG":true}
