The dataset includes extracted frames from the original .avi video files, as well as manually ground-truthed frame correspondences. The dataset was first used in the ICRA2012 Best Robot Vision Paper:</p>\n<p>M. Milford, G. Wyeth, \"SeqSLAM: Visual route-based navigation for sunny summer days and stormy winter nights\", in IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation, St Paul, United States, 2012.</p>\n<p>If you use this dataset please cite the above paper.
