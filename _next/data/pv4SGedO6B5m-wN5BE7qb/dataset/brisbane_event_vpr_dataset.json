{"pageProps":{"datasetData":{"content":"<p>Brisbane-Event-VPR was captured in the Brookfield and Kenmore Hills outer suburbs of Brisbane. The route is approx. 8km long and contains a variety of different roads, ranging from single-lane roads without much build-up over dual carriageways to built-up areas. Some areas contain many trees that cast shadows on the street and lead to challenging lighting conditions. The dataset includes 6 traverses recorded at different times of the day and under varying weather conditions. A DAVIS346 event camera was used to record the dataset; it was mounted forward-facing on the inside of the windshield of a Honda Civic. The DAVIS346 allows recording of events and aligned RGB frames with 346x260 pixels resolution.</p>\n<p><picture><source srcset=\"/_next/static/images/event-vpr-dataset-image-77ee27292f9a639c3024670f2a9939e2.png.webp\" type=\"image/webp\"><img alt=\"Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset\" src=\"/_next/static/images/event-vpr-dataset-image-179d4dc0b9d40cbdc11117c78f1d45de.png\"></picture></p>\n","name":"Brisbane-Event-VPR","type":"dataset","url":"https://zenodo.org/record/4302805","size":"80GB","id":"brisbane_event_vpr_dataset","image":"repo:Tobias-Fischer/ensemble-event-vpr/dataset.png","image_fit":"contain","_images":["/_next/static/images/dataset-77ee27292f9a639c3024670f2a9939e2.png.webp","/_next/static/images/dataset-179d4dc0b9d40cbdc11117c78f1d45de.png"],"src":"/content/visual_place_recognition/event-vpr-dataset.md","image_position":"center"}},"__N_SSG":true}
