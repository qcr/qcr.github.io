For full instructions on using an active agent within the environments with BenchBot we refer users to the BenchBot documentation. The link above gives access to the packaged Unreal \"games\" (not raw assets) for all environments, split into a development and challenge set, in line with the original scene understanding challenge. Develop contains house and miniroom. Challenge contains apartment, company, and office. Note that these ae just the environments. Ground truth object cuboid maps are located in the BenchBot add-ons <a href=\"https://github.com/benchbot-addons/ground_truths_isaac_develop\">ground_truths_isaac_develop</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/benchbot-addons/ground_truths_isaac_challenge\">ground_truths_isaac_challenge</a> respectively.</p>\n<p>For more details of the dataset, challenge, BenchBot, and how it all fits together, please see our summary video below:</p>\n<div class=\"embedded-block block-embed-service-youtube\"><iframe type=\"text/html\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/jQPkV29KFvI\" frameborder=\"0\" width=\"640\" height=\"390\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div>\n","name":"BenchBot Environments for Active Robotics (BEAR)","type":"dataset","url":"https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/pr8Bthtj2OFbg4R/download","size":"15.9GB","image":"./all_envs.png","_images":["/_next/static/images/all_envs-55ef0a35e02b68a820d9940edf6a1521.png.webp","/_next/static/images/all_envs-7573d0362a6d5ba5fc5e45e2542e99b9.png"],"src":"/content/benchbot/benchbot-bear-data.md","id":"benchbot-bear-data","image_position":"center"}},"__N_SSG":true}
