The data consists of visual data from a calibrated stereo pair, translation and orientation information as a ground truth from an XSens Mti-g INS/GPS and additional information from a USB NMEA GPS. The dataset traverses local roads and encounters a number of varying scenarios including roadworks, speed bumps, bright scenes, dark scenes, reverse traverses, a number of loop closure events, multi-lane roads, roundabouts and speeds of up to 60 km/h.</p>\n<p>Please see the author's page for up-to-date details and documentation on the dataset:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://michaelwarren.info/docs/datasets/uq-st-lucia-stereo-dataset/\">https://michaelwarren.info/docs/datasets/uq-st-lucia-stereo-dataset/</a></p>\n","name":"UQ St Lucia Vision","type":"dataset","url":"https://michaelwarren.info/docs/datasets/uq-st-lucia-stereo-dataset/","url_type":"external","image":"./uq_st_lucia.jpg","size":"38.1GB","_images":["/_next/static/images/uq_st_lucia-1d565cc939abfe002a470df1354ac6e8.jpg.webp","/_next/static/images/uq_st_lucia-cd1a4c432374b14373c4c98eb02e8d7c.jpg"],"src":"/content/legacy_datasets/uq_st_lucia.md","id":"uq-st-lucia","image_position":"center"}},"__N_SSG":true}
